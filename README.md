# Technical Support Ticketing Application

This is a basic prototype of a text-based (non-GUI) technical support ticketing application. The application allows users to categorize and log technical issues. Issue types are organized into categories and defined outside of the program in an external file.

## Features
- Categorize issues based on predefined categories.
- Log and view technical support tickets.
- Store and retrieve data from an external file.

## Usage
1. Define issue categories in `categories.txt`.
2. Run `ticketing_app.py` to log new tickets or view existing ones.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Ahmedelmoh/BA_task.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd BA_task.git`
3. Run the application: `python ticketing_app.py`
